# todb's dotfiles

This is where todb will be keeping his dotfiles. If he was really gutsy,
he'd symlink them to his computers, but that would mean that if you
compromised his GitHub account, you'd get to backdoor all his stuff.
So... maybe not.

Since todb is in the middle of a primary workstation rebuild, there
isn't a lot here yet.
